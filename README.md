Grunt Boilerplate
================

Simple boilerplate that uses grunt, sass, compass, imagemin, autoprefixer and watch. 

To use: Install the grunt CLI and CD in terminal to your downloaded repo, and run "grunt" which will automatically compile compass/sass & js on save. Install the livereleoad browser extension to have grunt auto-refresh your page in-browser when it's changed.
